# collaborative-painter
A light-weight drawing application that allows multiple users to draw synchronously on a server.
This application was written in D language (a modern language similar to C++). 
And it was built using the Gtk and Cairo API.

* This was my final project for the course Foundations of Software Engineering (course code: CS5500) at Northeastern University, taught by professor 
Mike Shah.
* Collaborators: Shibin Cai, Jay Gombar, Hui Juan.
